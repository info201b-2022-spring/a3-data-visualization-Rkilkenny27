Introduction and Summary Information:

For my analysis, I wanted to explore many aspects of the data set. Some of the specifics that I chose to calculate was the percent of certain races that were relevant. In order to calculate this value, I took the race that I was looking at and divided it by the total jail population. First off, I wanted to see what time period the data set covered. To find this, I found the first and last year of the data set, which started in 1970 and the last piece of data is in it from 2018. Next, I was curious to see what counties had the highest and lowest proportion of their populations in jail in 2002. To do this, I made a data frame of just the year 2002. Next, I mutated the data set to take the population in jail and divide by the total population to find this proportion. Then I found the name of the counties where these ratios were. The highest proportion was Reeves County, but the lowest was a tie between five different counties. After this, I was curious to see what proportion of African American inmates were overly represented than the average proportion in the county. To do this, I took the proportion of African Americans in jail, and summed up all of the times this occurred. After, I took this number 2,558, and divided it by 3,139, which is all the counties in 2002, and got the number .815. Lastly, I was curious to see the difference between certain years of total jail population, such as between 2002 and 2003. I found this by finding the total population in each year, and taking the difference of them which gave me the answer 1,888.

Visualization 1:

For my analysis over time, I wanted to see how the rates of incarceration for Whites and African Americans varied from 2001 to 2010 for the 3 biggest counties. This chart was included in order to plot out the relationship and see if any trends occurred. From the chart, it is seen that most of the rates stay pretty linear, except for Maricopa county, which has a slight decline in the white rate. Also, it can be seen in New York County that compared to the other two places, it has an unusually high rate for African Americans, and an unusually low rate for Whites. Based off the data set, the populations are roughly the same in terms of distribution, so there does not appear to be a distinct reason for this difference.

Visualization 2:

For my second visualization, I wanted to see how male and female jail populations are related from 2000 to 2017. I found data points for each by filtering the data down and creating a data frame to join together these values. After plotting them, I realized that as the total jail population for males goes up, the general trend is that the total amount for females goes up as well. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but this relationship does make logical sense.

Visualization 3:

For my third visualization, I wanted to see where there are the most juveniles in jail by state. In order to do this, I first added together male and females to get the total number. After doing this, I plotted it on the map in order to get a visual representation of where there is more and less. After doing this, I found a few general trends. First, the west has significantly less juveniles in jail as compared to the east. Also, while not as many as in New York, there seems to be a significant amount of juveniles in jail in southern states such as in Texas and Florida.
